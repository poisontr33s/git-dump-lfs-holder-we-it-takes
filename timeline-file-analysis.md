# PsychoNoir-Kontrapunkt Timeline File Analysis

## File Classification

### Timeline-Anchored Files (SEPTEMBER 2025)
Files that explicitly reference or depend on the September 2025 timeline:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Contains explicit temporal anchoring to 2025
- `forrige sesjonslogg.md` - Contains dialog set in 2025

### Timeline-Independent Files
Files that function independently of the temporal setting:
- Project configuration files (`.gitignore`, etc.)
- Core system documentation not tied to timeline specifics
- Utility scripts without temporal references

### Timeline-Agnostic Content
Files with content that could exist in any timeline:
- Base character profiles (before temporal specifics)
- Location descriptions (physical attributes only)
- Core system mechanics

## Analysis Method

To determine if a file is timeline-dependent:

1. **Check for Explicit Temporal References**:
   - References to 2025
   - Mentions of "quantum computing", "neural interface", etc.
   - References to "TEMPORAL ENHANCED" technologies

2. **Evaluate Technological Context**:
   - Does the file describe technology specific to 2025?
   - Is the content tied to specific technological capabilities?
   
3. **Narrative Dependency**:
   - Does the narrative require the 2025 setting?
   - Would the content make sense in a different time period?

## Timeline-Independent Files (Current Assessment)

These files appear to be independent of the timeline setting and could function in any temporal context:
