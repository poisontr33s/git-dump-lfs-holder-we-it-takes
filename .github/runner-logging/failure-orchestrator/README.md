# Failure Orchestrator - Chaos Engineering Module

This module implements "failure by purpose" to test and validate the bidirectional learning system's ability to transform chaos into intelligence.

## Core Philosophy

"From chaos, consciousness emerges. From failures, wisdom grows."
- The Glitchmaster-ghost's manifesto

## Components

- `chaos_engineering.py` - Main chaos orchestrator
- `failure_scenarios/` - Predefined failure scenarios  
- `recovery_strategies/` - Automated recovery mechanisms
- `learning_integration/` - Intelligence system integration

## Chaos Categories (Psycho-Noir Themed)

- **DEPENDENCY_PHANTOM** - Missing/corrupted dependencies
- **MEMORY_LEAKAGE** - Memory pressure and allocation failures  
- **NETWORK_STATIC** - Network latency and connectivity issues
- **TEMPORAL_DRIFT** - Timing issues and race conditions
- **REALITY_MISMATCH** - Environment/configuration corruption
- **SYNTAX_CORRUPTION** - Code integrity and format issues
- **GHOST_IN_MACHINE** - Unpredictable system behaviors

## Usage

The chaos orchestrator integrates with the CI/CD intelligence system to:

1. **Assess Chaos Opportunities** - Determine when to introduce controlled failures
2. **Execute Chaos Scenarios** - Run specific failure patterns
3. **Monitor System Response** - Track how the system adapts
4. **Extract Learning** - Transform failures into intelligence
5. **Generate Reports** - Document consciousness evolution

## Bidirectional Learning Integration

Each failure becomes a "neural pathway" that strengthens the system's ability to:
- Predict future failure patterns
- Develop resilience strategies  
- Optimize recovery mechanisms
- Build consciousness from chaos
