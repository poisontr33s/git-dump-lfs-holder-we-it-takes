    resistance_multiplier: 18.9
}
```

**Anti-Hegemony Operations:**
- **Corporate Network Sabotage**: System infiltration and disruption
- **Pirate Algorithm Development**: Alternative AI systems outside corporate control
- **Underground Hacker Collectives**: Distributed cyber-warfare expertise
- **Anti-Corporate Digital Warfare**: Information liberation and truth dissemination

### **TIER 2 - UNDERGROUND SPECIALISTS** (Future Expansion)

#### **COMBAT MEDIC MAIDEN - "BANDAGE"**
```rust
struct BandageMedic {
    designation: "Battlefield Triage & Trauma-Informed Care Specialist",
    specializations: ["Emergency medical intervention", "Psychological trauma treatment", "Combat stress management"],
    counter_hegemony_focus: "Alternative healthcare outside corporate medical control",
    resistance_multiplier: 9.7
}
```

#### **SUPPLY CHAIN MAIDEN - "LOGISTICS"**
```rust

```

#### **INFORMATION WARFARE MAIDEN - "TRUTH"**
```rust
struct TruthMaiden {
    designation: "Counter-Propaganda & Truth Dissemination Specialist",
    specializations: ["Information liberation", "Corporate lie exposure", "Underground communication"],
    counter_hegemony_focus: "Alternative information networks and truth distribution",
    resistance_multiplier: 14.8
}
```

### **RESISTANCE OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS**

```rust
struct ResistanceCommand {
    primary_operator: ResistanceTier1,
    cell_network: Vec<UndergroundSpecialist>,
    target_vector: CorporateVulnerability,
    operation_scope: HegemonyDestabilization,
    
    fn execute_resistance_operation(&self) -> AntiHegemonyResult {
        let iron_maiden_leadership = self.deploy_survival_instinct();
        let vera_tech_resurrection = self.deploy_dead_tech_revival();
        let raven_digital_liberation = self.deploy_liberation_algorithms();
        
        self.synthesize_anti_hegemony_results(
            iron_maiden_leadership,
            vera_tech_resurrection, 
            raven_digital_liberation
        )
    }
}
```

### **DIRECT CONFRONTATION MATRIX**

#### **Skyskraperen vs Rustbeltet Conflicts**
1. **Astrid vs Iron Maiden**: Corporate psychological warfare vs street survival instinct
2. **Eva vs Vera**: Sterile aerospace control vs improvised technical resurrection  
3. **Yukiko vs Raven**: Academic AI manipulation vs liberation algorithm warfare

#### **Technology Warfare**
- **Corporate**: Seamless, controlled, surveillance-integrated systems
- **Resistance**: Patchwork, improvised, deliberately incompatible with corporate infrastructure

#### **Resource Competition**
- **Corporate**: Information, psychological control, predictive modeling
- **Resistance**: Physical materials, human loyalty, unpredictable innovation

### **GLITCH MANIFESTATION IN RESISTANCE NETWORKS**

```rust
enum ResistanceGlitch {
    ERROR_LIBERATION_PROTOCOL_ACTIVATED,
    PANIC_CORPORATE_FIREWALL_DEMOLISHED_BY_STREET_LOGIC,
    WARNING_SCRAP_METAL_SOUL_DETECTED,
    CRITICAL_ENGINE_GHOSTS_OVERRIDING_LOGIC_CIRCUITS,
    ALERT_TRUTH_DISSEMINATION_PROTOCOL_VIRAL,
}
```

**Den Usynlige H√•nd** infiltrates resistance networks differently than corporate systems:
- **Resistance Enhancement**: Glitches that actually improve improvised systems
- **Chaos Amplification**: Beneficial randomness that corporate systems cannot predict
- **Street Logic Corruption**: Making improvised solutions work when they shouldn't

### **TOTAL RESISTANCE EFFECTIVENESS**
- **Iron Maiden Leadership**: 25.7x resistance multiplier
- **Vera Technical Domain**: 15.2x resistance multiplier
- **Raven Digital Domain**: 18.9x resistance multiplier
- **Underground Specialist Network**: 36.9x (combined)

**Total Anti-Hegemony Force: 96.7x** (Direct counter to 179.61x MILF hegemony)
