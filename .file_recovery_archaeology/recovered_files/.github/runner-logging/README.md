# Runner Logging System

This directory contains the comprehensive CI/CD logging and debugging infrastructure for the Psycho-Noir Kontrapunkt project.

## System Architecture

The logging system implements a "bidirectional intelligence" approach where errors become building blocks for system improvement, aligned with the project's psycho-noir aesthetic where technology has its own evolving consciousness.

## Components

- `error-classifier/` - Hierarchical error classification (Green/Yellow/Red)
- `log-aggregator/` - Runner output collection and processing 
- `intelligence-engine/` - Bidirectional learning from errors
- `reporting/` - Structured reports and visualizations
- `integration/` - CI workflow integration tools
