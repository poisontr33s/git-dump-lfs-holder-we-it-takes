# Ethical AI Coding Assistance Alternatives (SEPTEMBER 2025)

## Data Sovereignty Concerns with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot's closed API approach raises legitimate concerns:

1. **Data Harvesting**: Your creative work and coding patterns are being used to train models you have limited access to
2. **Forced Interface**: The ephemeral nature of inline chat forces a specific workflow
3. **Limited Agency**: Users have limited control over how their data is used
4. **EU Regulatory Considerations**: GDPR and the AI Act have specific requirements around data processing transparency

## Implementation Guide

To transition from GitHub Copilot to a more ethical alternative:

1. **Assess your needs**: What features do you actually use? What's your privacy threshold?
2. **Start local**: Try Ollama with CodeLlama to see if local models meet your needs
3. **Hybrid approach**: Consider using GitHub Copilot for simple completions but an alternative for more creative work
4. **Advocate**: Provide feedback to GitHub about your concerns
